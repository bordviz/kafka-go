## About project

This project is a simple example of using the Kafka message broker with Golang applications. This example implements a cluster of two Kafka servers - they have a common topic and 2 partitions that are shared between the servers, in addition one server stores replications of the other and can completely replace it in case of failure. Two consumers have been implemented on Go, as well as a produser with an HTTP server responsible for sending messages to Kafka.

## Kafka UI

To use the Kafka UI after running the service via Docker, go to `http://localhost:8090`
